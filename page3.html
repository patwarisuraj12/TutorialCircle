                            <h2>Pigeonhole Principle</h2>
                            <p>In 1834, German mathematician, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, stated a principle which he called
                                the drawer principle. Now, it is known as the pigeonhole principle.</p>
                            <p>Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are fewer pigeon holes than total number of pigeons
                                and each pigeon is put in a pigeon hole, then there must be at least one pigeon hole with
                                more than one pigeon. If n pigeons are put into m pigeonholes where n > m, there's a hole
                                with more than one pigeon.</p>
                            <h2>Examples</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Ten men are in a room and they are taking part in handshakes. If each person shakes hands at least once and no man shakes
                                    the same man’s hand more than once then two men took part in the same number of handshakes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    There must be at least two people in a class of 30 whose names start with the same alphabet.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            

                        </div>
